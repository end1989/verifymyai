# Privacy Policy — VerifyMyAI

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Summary

VerifyMyAI collects nothing. Zero data leaves your browser.

## Details

- **No analytics.** No Google Analytics, no Plausible, no Mixpanel, nothing.
- **No cookies.** Not even "strictly necessary" ones.
- **No tracking pixels.** No Facebook Pixel, no ad network scripts.
- **No accounts.** No sign-up, no email capture, no login.
- **No external requests.** The app loads once, then runs entirely in your browser. It makes no API calls, no beacon requests, no server-side processing.
- **No data storage.** Your audit results exist only in your browser's memory. Close the tab and they're gone. The only localStorage keys used are `theme` (light/dark preference) and `pwa-install-dismissed` (whether you dismissed the install prompt).
- **No server.** This is a static site hosted on Cloudflare Pages. There is no backend, no database, no server-side code.

## Report generation

When you generate a report (PDF/ZIP), the file is created entirely in your browser using jsPDF and JSZip. No data is sent anywhere. The file downloads directly to your device.

## Open source

The complete source code is available at [github.com/end1989/verifymyai](https://github.com/end1989/verifymyai). Anyone can verify these claims by reading the code.
