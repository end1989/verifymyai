# Code of Conduct

## Why This Matters Here

This project deals with AI-facilitated abuse, surveillance, and coercive control. Contributors and community members may include survivors of domestic violence, advocates, researchers, and people currently in dangerous situations. The standards we hold ourselves to reflect that reality.

## Our Standards

**Expected behavior:**

- Treat all contributors with respect and empathy
- Prioritize user safety in every design decision and code review
- Use neutral, non-judgmental language — especially in user-facing content
- Accept constructive feedback gracefully
- Respect that contributors may have personal experience with the issues this tool addresses

**Unacceptable behavior:**

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Dismissing or minimizing domestic violence, coercive control, or tech-facilitated abuse
- Publishing others' private information
- Attempting to identify or contact users of the tool
- Using project infrastructure to track, monitor, or collect data about anyone
- Suggesting features that compromise user privacy or anonymity

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to **end1989@users.noreply.github.com**.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter.

Consequences for violations:

1. **Warning** — Private written notice with explanation
2. **Temporary ban** — Removal from project spaces for a specified period
3. **Permanent ban** — Permanent removal from all project spaces

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces — GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other channels associated with VerifyMyAI.
